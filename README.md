## Getting started

After setting the working environment let's start with...

[Sign Up for a Twitch Developer Account](https://dev.twitch.tv/console)

[OAuth Scopes](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication#scopes)

After signing up, you can get your token by visiting:

`https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?client_id= 'CLIENT_ID'&redirect_uri= 'YOUR_HOST'&response_type=token&scope=channel:moderate+chat:edit+chat:read`

After authorizing, you will be rdirected to `YOUR_HOST` and the access token will be in the URL `access_token` param.

Replace `CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_HOST` with the values for your newly created Twitch application from the dev portal.

At the end, when everything is set, run the bot with a command:

`npm start`

or

`yarn start`
